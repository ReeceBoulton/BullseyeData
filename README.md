# BullseyeData
A repository of the GIFs associated with the Project B work: Silicon Photonic Bullseye Gratings for Coupling to Single Quantum Emitters

NB: All gifs presented here were created by Reece Boulton with the exception of 26G4 FDTD, which was created by Mike Neville

26G4 2d.gif contains a 2-dimensional far-field reflected power distribution of bullseye 26G4 under white light illumination, sweeping through wavelength in time.
The number at the top of the gif is the wavelength of the distribution shown.
The horizontal axis is the horizontal fibre position, in mm
The vertical axis is the vertical fibre position, in mm
The data has been dark corrected and divided by a measurement of a protected silver mirror, which contains information of the white light spectrum and spectrometer response
As such the "power" displayed is dimensionless

26G4 Extended.gif contains a 2-dimensional far-field reflected power distribution of bullseye 26G4 under white light illumination, sweeping through wavelength in time.
This gif differs from 26G4 2d.gif in that it extended to higher values of y, as well as having had the data from y=6.4 and above retaken.
The number at the top of the gif is the wavelength of the distribution shown.
The horizontal axis is the horizontal fibre position, in mm
The vertical axis is the vertical fibre position, in mm
The data has been dark corrected and divided by a measurement of a protected silver mirror, which contains information of the white light spectrum and spectrometer response
As such the distribution displayed is dimensionless

26G4 FDTD.gif contains a simulation of 2-dimensional far-field reflected power distribution of bullseye 26G4 under white light illumination, sweeping through wavelength in time.
This gif contains the results of a FDTD simulation of bullseye 26G4 under focussed gaussian illumination.
The number at the top of the gif is the wavelength of the distribution shown.
The power has been normalised with respect to its peak value, which is not known to me.

26E4 Extended.gif contains a 2-dimensional far-field reflected power distribution of bullseye 26E4 under white light illumination, sweeping through wavelength in time.
The number at the top of the gif is the wavelength of the distribution shown.
The horizontal axis is the horizontal fibre position, in mm
The vertical axis is the vertical fibre position, in mm
The data has been dark corrected and divided by a measurement of a protected silver mirror, which contains information of the white light spectrum and spectrometer response
As such the distribution displayed is dimensionless
